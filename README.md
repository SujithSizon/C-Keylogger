# C-Keylogger
A basic program written in primitive C++ to show the working of computer keyloggers.


In an attempt to explore the basics of spyware code i decided to make a program that could run on primitve C++ compilers, eventhough the sole purpose of keylogging was reduced ive tried to keep the main theme intact.

Keyloggers are spyware programs that are installed on victim's computer (college/school/girlfriend..) to get confidential informations like passwords,messages.. as letters get typed on the victim's keyboard. This is simpler spyware tool compared to phishing web pages. 

Disadvantage of Phishing Web page:
you have to upload phishing web page to web hosting.  But only few website won't detect the phishing webpage.
website url is different. Easy to detect that we are hacking.

Advantage of Spyware-keylogger:
Very simple and easy method.
Victim can't detect that we are hacking.

Disclaimer:
No girlfriends/teachers.. where harmed during testing of the code.


How to:
1) Download DevC++ from here: http://www.bloodshed.net/ and refresh some of your basics of C++(need, if you are going to develop the code).

2) Go to File->New->Source File.

3) Now add your modifications and execute the program by selecting Execute->Run(ctrl+F10)

Now your keylogger will run in your system. whatever you type using keyboard. It will be stored in Log.txt file.You can see the log.txt file in your program directory.

4) Bind the exe file with image or any files and send it to your friend.

If you have physical access to your college/school system,then copy the exe file in that system and run it.
